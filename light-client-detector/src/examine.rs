//
//  1. The light client verifies a header that is different to the intermediate header in the trace. This
//     is the bifurcation point and the light client can create evidence from it
//  2. The source stops responding, doesn't have the block or sends an invalid header in which case we
//     return the error and remove the witness
//

//  1. Trace can not be empty len(trace) > 0
//  2. The last block in the trace can not be of a lower height than the target block
//     trace[len(trace)-1].Height >= targetBlock.Height
//  3. The last block in the trace is conflicting with the target block
