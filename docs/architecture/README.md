# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This is a location to record all high-level architecture decisions in the
cometbft-rs project.

You can read more about the ADR concept in this [blog
post](https://product.reverb.com/documenting-architecture-decisions-the-reverb-way-a3563bb24bd0#.78xhdix6t).

An ADR should provide:

- Context on the relevant goals and the current state to explain why a decision
  must be made now
- The decision that will allow us to achieve the goals
- Summary of pros and cons if we make the decision
- References
- Changelog

Note the distinction between an ADR and a spec. The ADR provides the context,
intuition, reasoning, and justification for a change in architecture, or for the
architecture of something new. The spec is a much more compressed and
streamlined summary of everything as it is or should be.

If recorded decisions turned out to be lacking, convene a discussion, record the
new decisions here, and then modify the code to match.

Note the context/background should be written in the present tense.

To suggest an ADR, please make use of the [ADR template](./adr-template.md)
provided.
