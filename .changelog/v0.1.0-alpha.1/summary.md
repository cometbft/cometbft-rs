First pre-release of the crates under cometbft-rs naming.

The renamed project's crates are released with versioning restarted from 0.1.0.
The API naming has been changed from Tendermint to CometBFT where appropriate.
The new versioned structure of .proto files published in CometBFT 1.0 is used
to generate protobuf data marshalling structures in cometbft-proto.
