[CometBFT] client framework in Rust with [TLA+ specifications](/docs/spec).

CometBFT is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault
tolerant applications written in any programming language.

## CometBFT Compatibility

cometbft-rs has been tested for compatibility with CometBFT v0.34.x, v0.37.x and v0.38.x.

## Requirements

Tested against the latest stable version of Rust. May work with older versions.

### Semantic Versioning

We do our best to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). However, as
we are pre-v1.0.0, we use the MINOR version to refer to breaking changes and the
PATCH version for features, improvements, and fixes.

We use the same version for all crates and release them collectively.
